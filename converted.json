One such problem in the service sector is   university course timetabling , which involves assigning courses to classrooms and instructors   while considering constraints such as faculty availability, classroom capacity, and student   preferences. Efficient scheduling in higher education minimizes conflicts, reduces resource   wastage , and enhances overall educational experiences   for both students and faculty.    1.2 Literature Review    University course scheduling has been extensively researched, with various optimization   techniques applied to solve the  University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP) .   One widely   used approach involves  mathematical modeling techniques ,   such as  Linear Integer Programming   (LIP) ,   which formally expresses the constraints and objectives of UCTP. Studies such as  Naderi   (2016)   have proposed LIP models to optimize instructor - course assignments, ensuring feasible   and efficient scheduling.    Given that  UCTP is NP - hard , researchers have explored  heuristic and metaheuristic   algorithms   to find near - optimal solutions efficiently. Techniques such as  Genetic Algorithms   (GA),   Simulated Annealing (SA), and  Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS)   have been widely   applied in university timetabling problems  (Burke et al., 2007; Lü & Hao, 2010) . These methods   offer flexible and scalable solutions when exact optimization techniques become computationally   infeasible for large - scale instances."

Machine learning, constraint programming, and   reinforcement learning   have been investigated as potential solutions to optimize scheduling by   learning from historical data and dynamically adjusting constraints  (Shiau, 2011) .   These AI -  driven methods aim to improve adaptability and efficiency, making them promising approaches   for future research in university course scheduling.    1. 3   Problem Definition    The  University Course Timetabling Problem (UCTP)   is a well - known combinatorial   optimization problem that requires the allocation of limited resources, such as instructors,   classrooms, and time slots, to a set of courses in a way that satisfies various constraints. The goal   is to generate an optimal sche dule that maximizes faculty preferences, minimizes operational   costs, and ensures smooth academic operations.    The UCTP consists of two binary decision  dimensions:    •   Instructor Assignment : Determining which faculty members will teach specific courses.    •   Class Scheduling : Assigning courses to appropriate classrooms and time slots while   avoiding conflicts.    These decisions are subject to multiple constraints:    •   Hard Constraints   (must be strictly satisfied):    o   No instructor can be assigned to two courses simultaneously.    o   No classroom can accommodate multiple courses at the same time."

Ensuring that their   teaching schedules do not conflict with these commitments is crucial  (Causmaecker et   al., 2009) .    •   Classroom Capacity and Availability:   Classrooms vary in size and facilities and must   be assigned based on the specific needs of each course (e.g., lab facilities, seating   capacity). The goal is to maximize the utilization of available classroom space while   avoiding conflicts  (Boland et al., 2008) .    •   Student Preferences:   Students often have preferences for certain courses and instructors,   as well as scheduling preferences to avoid time conflicts with other courses they are   enrolled in  (Shiau, 2011) .    •   Curriculum Requirements:   Courses must be scheduled in accordance with the   curriculum requirements of various programs, ensuring that students can complete their   required courses in a timely manner  (Daskalaki & Birbas, 2005) .    •   Institutional Policies:   These include policies related to workload distribution, fair   allocation of teaching responsibilities, and adherence to accreditation standards  (Al -  Yakoob & Sherali, 2007) .    1. 5   Importance of UCTP in the Service Industry    The  University Course  Timetabling Problem (UCTP)   plays a crucial role in the education   sector, which functions as a service industry responsible for delivering knowledge and academic   resources to students.

Proper scheduling also significantly   impacts  student satisfaction , as well - structured timetables provide flexible course schedules that   align with student preferences and academic needs  (Burke et al., 2007) .    Additionally, a well - balanced timetable promotes  faculty work - life balance   by   distributing teaching responsibilities fairly, reducing burnout, and improving job satisfaction   (Causmaecker et al., 2009) .   From an administrative perspective, efficient course scheduling   minimizes manual efforts, reduces scheduling errors, and leads to  administrative cost reductions ,   ensuring that institutions allocate resources effectively while avoiding last - minute adjustments   (Boland et al., 2008) .    On the other hand, inefficient scheduling can have significant negative consequences.   Resource wastage   occurs when classrooms are underutilized, leading to inefficient faculty time   allocation and higher operational costs  (Daskalaki & Birbas, 2005) .   Additionally,  conflicts and   overlaps   in course schedules can prevent students from enrolling in required courses, delaying   their graduation and negatively affecting academic progress  (Shiau, 2011) .   Poor scheduling may   also result in  faculty and student dissatisfa ction , as inconvenient class times, excessive faculty   workloads, and suboptimal learning experiences create frustration and inefficiencies  (Lü & Hao,   2010) .   Finally,  operational inefficiencies   arise when universities must frequently make manual   adjustments to resolve scheduling conflicts, diverting administrative resources from other   academic priorities  (Al - Yakoob & Sherali, 2007) .    Thus, addressing the UCTP through efficient optimization techniques is essential for   ensuring smooth academic operations, reducing conflicts, and enhancing the overall educational   experience for all stakeholders."

Data Loading and Preprocessing   -   The model inputs were sourced from an Excel file   titled  uctp - base - model - data.xlsx , which contained separate sheets for Lecturers, Courses,   Rooms, Days, Time Periods, and various Preference Tables. These datasets provided the   necessary structure for constructing a comprehensive timetabling model. During   preprocessing, missing preference   values were automatically filled with default constants   to ensure completeness and consistency. Specifically, a value of 2 was used to repres ent a   neutral preference, 1 indicated a preferred option, and 0 signified unavailability or   incompatibility. This normalization allowed for uniform handling of soft and hard   constraints throughout the model.    2.   Index and Parameter Definitions   -   The next step involved extracting the key sets and   dimensions required for the model. These included the number of lecturers (L), courses   (C), rooms (R), days (D), and time periods (T). These sets were derived dynamically   based on the contents of the Excel   file. To facilitate efficient lookups during constraint   formulation, we constructed dictionaries in Python representing the soft constraint   preference matrices: p1 for lecturer - course preferences, p2 for lecturer - day pref erences,   and p3 for course - day preferences. Similarly, we defined three availability mappings (a1,   a2, a3) to represent whether a lecturer is available on a given day, qualified to teach a   course, or whether a course is compatible with a particular room.    3.   Decision Variable Creation   -   Two primary binary decision variables were introduced to   model the problem: Z[l,c,d,r,t] and X[l,d]. The variable Z[l,c,d,r,t ] equals 1 if lecturer  l   is   scheduled to teach course  c   on day  d   in room  r   at time  t ; otherwise, it is 0. This captures   the full granularity of a teaching assignment. The auxiliary variable X[l,d] equals 1 if   lecturer  l   is scheduled to teach on day  d , and 0 otherwise.

Constraint  Modelling   -   The model incorporated all core hard constraints defined in the   mathematical formulation using OR - Tools' AddExactlyOne, AddAtMostOne, and   standard logical constraints. These constraints ensure: (1) each course is assigned exactly   once across all lecturer - r oom - day - time combinations; (2) no lecturer is assigned to more   than one course during the same time slot; (3) lecturers are only scheduled on days they   are available; and (4) courses are only scheduled in rooms that meet their compatibility   requirements . These logical conditions collectively guarantee the feasibility of the   timetable with respect to institutional policies and physical limitations.    5.   Objective Function   -   The optimization goal of the model was to maximize total   scheduling satisfaction by incorporating three soft constraint preferences: lecturer - course   (p1), lecturer - day (p2), and course - day (p3). This was expressed through a weighted   summation of the binary   decision variables and their associated preference scores. The   objective was implemented using OR - Tools' model.Maximize(...) function, ensuring the   solver prioritized high - preference assignments wherever feasible.    6.

Building upon the foundational work of Naderi (2016), our extended model incorporated   operationally realistic constraints including instructor workload limits, session patterns   (MWF/TTh), consistent time slots, room type and accessibility require ments, single - location   teaching policies, and building transfer buffers.    The implementation evolved from a code - first prototype to a mathematically structured,   AI - assisted solution. Through iterative refinement, model runtime was reduced significantly —  from 23 minutes in early versions to just 2 minutes in the final model. The i ntegration of   preference - based soft constraints ensured that the resulting timetable was not only feasible but   also optimized for quality and institutional alignment.    The project demonstrates that real - world academic timetabling can be effectively   modelled   as a mixed constraint satisfaction and optimization problem. The resulting solution is   scalable, adaptable, and capable of supporting decision - making in higher education scheduling.    4 .2 Future Work & Recommendations    To further enhance the model’s applicability and performance, we recommend the   following extensions and areas of research:      1.
